## NFT-Gated voting system & proof-of-activity

In this project a community can emit a NFT to their members, making them able to vote on proposals, getting empowered to decide things in a secure, decentralized and balanced way. <br/>
Each time a member votes on a proposal their NFT evolve. This way, the more active a member is, the more evolved their NFT will be, acting as a proof-of-activity on decisions <br/>
The NFT-Gated system ensures that members can only vote once, and their have a pseudo "credential" of being part of the community.  <br/>
The trustless nature of the blockchain ensures that these votations cannot be manipulated, as all the transactions are fully on-chain. <br/>
