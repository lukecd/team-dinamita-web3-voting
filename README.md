## NFT-Gated voting system & proof-of-activity

A community can emit a NFT for their members, which enables them to vote on proposals, getting empowered to decide things in a secure, decentralized and balanced way. <br/>

The NFT-gated system ensures that members can only vote once, everyone have the same votepower and a pseudo "credential" of being part of the community. <br/> 
Each time a member votes on a proposal their NFT get evolved, representing the number of times the member has voted. This way, the more active a member is, the more evolved their NFT will be, acting as a proof-of-activity <br/>

The NFT credential can be embedded and shared in any website using the alchemy API. <br/>
The NFT credential can also be used to gate any community activities, allowing only holders to participate. <br/>

The trustless nature of the blockchain ensures that these votations cannot be manipulated, as all the transactions are fully transparent (on-chain). <br/>
